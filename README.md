# Reinforcement-Learning

This repo shows the track of me learning reinforcement learning. I learn by reading the book of Reinforcement Learning written by Richard Sutton. To enforce my knowledge, I solved some problems in the book and implement algorithms described in the book to solve small games/puzzles. 
The content includes:
1. Gambler's problem implemented by on-policy Monte Carlo Control with exploring starts for action values.
A Gambler's problem is described in the book as such:  
    A gambler has the opportunity to make bets on the outcomes of a sequence of coin ﬂips. If the coin comes up heads, he wins as many dollars as he has staked on that ﬂip; if it is tails, he loses his stake. The game ends when the gambler wins by reaching his goal of $100, or loses by running out of money. On each ﬂip, the gambler must decide what portion of his capital to stake, in integer numbers of dollars.
    





Reinforcement learning is my entrance to ML/DL. Some concepts in Reinforcement Learning share with ML/DL. The interface of User-Agent make me feel comfortable to learn the idea of RL beside complex Math. The algorithms in the book is not very hard to understand and to implement. Therefore after reading this book, I deside to explore more in AI area.
